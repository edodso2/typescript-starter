# TypeScript Starter

A very basic starter for typescript projects. The project uses parcel for realtime compiling and page refresh.

## Running the code

To download & run the code:
1. `git clone https://github.com/edodso2/typescript-starter.git`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. Open http://localhost:1234/ and you should see 'hello world' in the console.

## Including TypeScript in an already created project

As of the latest update to this repository parcel is the easiest way to get started with TypeScript development. All you have to do is:

1. install parcel
2. create the tsconfig.json file (or use the one in this repository as a starting point)
2. add your TS file(s) to index.html using a script tag
3. run `parcel index.html` and like magic a server starts where you can view the compiled project in the browser
